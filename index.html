        <p id="def1"> The golden ratio is also called the golden mean or golden section (Latin: sectio aurea). Other

      <h2 id="head1">Various Aspects of Golden Ratio</h2>

      <div class="container1 ">
        <p class="def2">
        <ul id="h1">1) Numeric definition</ul><br>
        <li>Here is a 'Fibonacci series'.<br>
          0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ..<br>
          If we take the ratio of two successive numbers in this series and divide each by the
          number before it, we will find the following series of numbers.<br>
          1/1 = 1<br>
          2/1 = 2<br>
          3/2 = 1.5<br>
          5/3 = 1.6666...<br>
          8/5 = 1.6<br>
          13/8 = 1.625<br>
          21/13 = 1.61538...<br>
          34/21 = 1.61904...<br>
          The ratio seems to be settling down to a particular value, which we call the golden
          ratio(Phi=1.618..).</li><br>

        <ul> 2) Geometric definition</ul><br>
        <li> can notice if we have a 1 by 1 square and add a square with side lengths equal<br>
          to the length longer rectangle side, then what remains is another golden rectangle.<br>
          This could go on forever. We can get bigger and bigger golden rectangles, adding<br>
          off these big squares.<br>
          Step 1 Start with a square 1 by 1<br>
          Step 2 Find the longer sideV
          Step 3 Add another square of that side to whole thingV
          Here is the list we can get adding the square;<br>
          1 x 1, 2 x 1, 3 x 2, 5 x 3, 8 x 5, 13 x 8, 21 x 13, 34 x 21.<br>
          with each addition coming ever closer to multiplying by Phi.<br>
          start 1 by 1, add 1 by 1 => Now, it is 2 by 1, add 2 by 2<br>
          Now, it is 3 by 2, add 3 by 3 => Now, it is 5 by 3, add 5 by 5<br>
          Now, it is 8 by 5.</li><br>



        <ul>3) Algebraic and Geometric definition</ul><br>
        <li>We can realize that Phi + 1 = Phi * Phi.
          Start with a golden rectangle with a short side one unit long.
          Since the long side of a golden rectangle equals the short side multiplied by Phi,
          the long side of the new rectangle is 1*Phi = Phi.
          If we swing the long side to make a new golden rectangle, the short side of the new
          rectangle is Phi and the long side is Phi * Phi.
          We also know from simple geometry that the new long side equals the sum of the
          two sides of the original rectangle, or Phi + 1. (figure in page4)
          Since these two expressions describe the same thing, they are equivalent, and so
          Phi + 1 = Phi * Phi.</li>

    <!-- History -->

    <h2 id="history" class="his">History Of Golden Ratio</h2>

    <p class="history">
      a. The uses date to the ancient Egyptians and Greeks

      To begin with, in one of the Seven Wonders, the Egyptian Great Pyramid constructed in 2580-2560 BC, the Golden
      Ratio can be found: the ratio of the slant height of pyramid to half the base dimension is 1.61804, which is
      extremely close to the Golden Ratio. Greeks also showed the advanced understanding of the Golden Ratio. Phidias
      (500 BC – 432 BC), Plato (circa 428 BC – 347 BC), Euclid (365 BC – 300 BC), had put the ratio in their works. One
      of the example could be the Parthenon, one of the most famous buildings in Greece, whose shortest base length and
      the height form a Golden rectangle.<br>
      b. The Fibonacci Series was discovered around 1200 AD

      Leonardo Fibonacci, an Italian born in 1175 AD (2) discovered the unusual properties of the numerical series that
      now bears his name. In 1202, with the reproduction of the rabbits, Fibonacci mentioned his sequence that had
      already been worked out earlier in the ancient Hindu Pignala ‘s Chandahsastra around 200 BC. The limit of the
      sequence produced by the quotients of the members of the well-known recursive Fibonacci sequence(Fn+2 = Fn+1+Fn,
      F0=1, F1=1)is equal to the Golden Ratio, that is Φ<br>

      c. The “Divine Proportion” in the 1500’s

      During the Middle Age, this ratio was furtherly developed. Leonardo Da Vinci explored the human body involving in
      the ratios of the lengths of various body parts. He called this ratio the "divine proportion" and featured it in
      many of his paintings. This can be seen in the painting “The Last Supper”, from the dimensions of the table at
      which Christ and the disciples sat to the proportions of the walls and windows in the background. Johannes Kepler
      (1571-1630), German mathematician, astronomer, and astrologer, also made mention of the “Divine Proportion”.<br>

      d. The “Golden Ratio” was coined in the 1800’s and the symbol “ ("phi")” in the 20th century

      The term "golden section" (in German, goldener Schnitt or der goldene Schnitt) seems to first have been used by
      Martin Ohm in the 1835 2nd edition of his textbook Die Reine Elementar-Mathematik (Livio 2002, p. 6). The first
      known use of this term in English is in James Sulley's 1875 article on aesthetics in the 9th edition of the
      Encyclopedia Britannica. The symbol ("phi") was apparently first used by American mathematician Mark Barr at the
      beginning of the 20th century in commemoration of the Greek sculptor Phidias (ca. 490-430 BC), who a number of art
      historians claim made extensive use of the golden ratio in his works (Livio 2002, pp. 5-6), as well as to
      commemorate Fibonacc, whose name’s first letter “F” is equivalent to Greek “Phi”.<br>

          <p class="lead" id="flower">The head of a flower is also subject to Fibonaccian processes. Typically, seeds are produced
            at the center, and then migrate towards the outside to fill all the space. Sunflowers provide a great
            example of these spiraling patterns.In some cases, the seed heads are so tightly packed that total number
            can get quite high — as many as 144 or more. And when counting these spirals, the total tends to match a
            Fibonacci number. Interestingly, a highly irrational number is required to optimize filling (namely one that
            will not be well represented by a fraction). Phi fits the bill rather nicely.</p>

            itself to determine the composition of the artwork, using the path of the spiral in the golden rectangle,
            and even placing important subject matter at measured points inside the rectangle.
            The Golden Ratio Art in Painting
            Leonardo da Vinci
            Probably the most famous artist to put it to use is Leonardo da Vinci. Da Vinci illustrated a book written
            by Luca Pacioli in the late 15th century all about the Divine Proportion.
